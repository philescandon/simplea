I could not get the updated posts to render on the Netlify deployment although the files were updated.
I tried several different configurations - change the base directory, but could never get it to work.  Maybe the .md markdown files vs the .Rmd markdown files are a clue. .md uses the Goldmark markdown app while the .Rmd uses Pandoc & ?? something else.
